# Indices and ranges

This final example shows taking a moving average on a sequence of numbers that approaches a maximum value. As you move through the range looking at small samples of data, you can get a clear picture of general shape of the data.

```cs --project ./ExploreCsharpEight/ExploreCsharpEight.csproj --source-file ./ExploreCsharpEight/IndicesAndRanges.cs --region IndicesAndRanges_MovingAverage
```

Consider using this new syntax whenever you are working with subsets of data.
