# Azure Open Source Labs

A collection of labs to help build Open Source & Cloud Native applications with Azure, Microsoft, GitHub, and open source developer tools, platforms, and projects.

Our Open Source Labs were originally developed for [OSCON 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention). These are similar to labs such GopherCon (Azure Go Labs), PyCon (Azure Python Labs), KubeCon (Azure Container Labs), and other in-person and virtual events.

You can also join us on the [Microsoft Open Source Discord (aka.ms/open-source-discord)](https://aka.ms/open-source-discord) to connect with us and discuss any of the labs or related content in this repository.

## Latest

You can find the latest in-flight labs on the [latest-2022](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-opensource-labs/tree/latest-2022) branch. Please note you may experience breaking changes, but we would love to hear any feedback!


## OSCON / 2019

You can find original 2019 labs delivered in person at OSCON 2019 in the [2019](2019/#azure-open-source-labs-oscon-2019) sub-folder, where we will continue to tweak and update them, and the original version on the [oscon-2019](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-opensource-labs/tree/oscon-2019) branch. These include:

- Containerize a Django application using Visual Studio Code
- Windows for Open Source Developers
- Try .NET
- Developing a new Flask application in a Dev Container
- Developing a Django+PostgreSQL application in a Dev Container
- Use Azure Functions to build a RESTful API
- Containerize and Deploy a Python Flask application with Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Instances
- Use Hyperscale (Citus) to speed up analytics
- Try out the Intelligent Performance suite in Azure database services for MySQL and PostgreSQL
