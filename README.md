# Azure Open Source Labs

A collection of labs demonstrating how to build Open Source applications with Azure, Visual Studio Code and the Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL).

## Containerize a Django application using Visual Studio Code

Build a docker container to run a Django app using the Docker extension in Visual Studio Code to generate Dockerfiles and run the containers.

[Go to lab](1-vscode-django-docker/README.md)

## Windows for Open Source Developers

This project walks you through setting up and customizing a Windows PC for Open Source development. We'll introduce you to the Windows Terminal and Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL). At the end of this lab you'll use VS Code to debug a NodeJS project running in WSL.

## Try .NET

This workshop walks you through the C# fundamentals as well as C# 7 and 8 features without the use of an editor or IDE. By the end of the workshop, the user will walk away with an understanding of C#. If you are content creator hopefully, you will be inspired by [Try .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/creating-interactive-net-documentation/) blends on Markdown and interactive code snippets to build your next workshop or tutorial.

## Developing a Django+PostgreSQL application in a Dev Container

Open an existing dev container using Visual Studio Code remote extensions, build a React front-end, initialize a PostgreSQL database, and run a Django app. 

[Go to lab](2b-vscode-django-postgres-dev-container/README.md)

## Use Azure Functions to build a RESTful API

Create an Azure Functions serverless API that returns a a list of pets to be adopted. In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic REST API using Node.js Azure Functions and add dependencies from npm.

[Go to lab](3-vscode-serverless/README.md)

## Containerize and Deploy a Python Flask application with Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Instances

In this lab you will learn to:
1. Build a Python Flask application using Docker and a Dockerfile.
2. Build the container image in the cloud using Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3. Deploy the container image to Azure Container Instances (ACI).

[Go to lab](3-azure-cli-flask-registry-container-instances/README.md) | Duration: 5-10 minutes

## Use Hyperscale (Citus) to speed up analytics

This workshop is meant to be an introduction to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus). First, you will create a cluster to scale out PostgreSQL and turn it into a distributed database. Then, you will create a schema and tables, load test data, and create a rollup function to massively speed up your query workload. 

[Go to lab](4-postgres-citus/README.md)

## Try out the Intelligent Performance suite in Azure database services for MySQL and PostgreSQL
Azure offers managed database services for MySQL and PostgreSQL. In this hands-on lab, explore how to understand and improve your query performance using the Intelligent Performance suite of features.
