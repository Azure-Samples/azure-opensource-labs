# Azure Open Source Labs

A collection of labs to help build Open Source & Cloud Native applications with Azure, Microsoft, GitHub, and open source developer tools, platforms, and projects.

Our Open Source Labs were originally developed for [OSCON 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention). These are similar to labs such GopherCon (Azure Go Labs), PyCon (Azure Python Labs), KubeCon (Azure Container Labs), and other in-person and virtual events, many of which will continue to be updated in this repository.

You can also join us on the [Microsoft Open Source Discord (aka.ms/open-source-discord)](https://aka.ms/open-source-discord) to connect with us and discuss any of the labs or related content in this repository.
