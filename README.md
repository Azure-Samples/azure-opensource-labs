## Try .NET

This workshop walks you through the C# fundamentals as well as C# 7 and 8 features without the use of an editor or IDE. By the end of the workshop, the user will walk away with an understanding of C#. If you are content creator hopefully, you will be inspired by [Try .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/creating-interactive-net-documentation/) blends on Markdown and interactive code snippets to build your next workshop or tutorial.

## Containerize and Deploy a Python Flask application with Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Instances

In this lab you will learn to:
1. Build a Python Flask application using Docker and a Dockerfile.
2. Build the container image in the cloud using Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3. Deploy the container image to Azure Container Instances (ACI).

## Use Hyperscale (Citus) to speed up analytics

This workshop is meant to be an introduction to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus). First, you will create a cluster to scale out PostgreSQL and turn it into a distributed database. Then, you will create a schema and tables, load test data, and create a rollup function to massively speed up your query workload.
